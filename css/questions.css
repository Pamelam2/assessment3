@media screen and (max-width:960px){};

@media screen and (min-width:720px){};


/*
    Q3 - What CSS property are you having the most trouble figuring out?
*/
Display: inline-block;  Should I use width with it every time? It may also be that, when I want to use it, preceeding it there's embedded media that uses float, so I should probably get in the habit of clearing the floats before using display.

/*
    Q4 - What is the best CSS property and why?
*/

There isn't a best. CSS is like a puzzle where all of the pieces work together to make a pretty picture.
